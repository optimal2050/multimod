\title{Read GAMS model file and parse its core structure.}
\usage{
read_gams(
  file_or_text,
  include = TRUE,
  interim_file = NULL,
  strict = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_or_text}{A path to a GAMS file or a character vector containing GAMS code.}

\item{include}{Logical indicating whether to expand included files (default is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{interim_file}{Optional path to an interim file where the processed GAMS code prepended for parsing will be saved. If \code{NULL}, no interim file is created.}

\item{strict}{Logical indicating whether to enforce strict parsing rules (default is \code{TRUE}). If \code{FALSE}, some undeclared equations may be added to the model structure.}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to print verbose output during parsing (default is \code{FALSE}).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to other functions, currently unused.}
}
\value{
A \code{model_structure} object containing the parsed GAMS model structure, including sets, mappings, aliases, parameters, variables, and equations.
}
\description{
This function reads a GAMS model file or text, expands any included files, removes comments, and parses the core structure into sets, parameters, variables, equations, and aliases, returning a \code{model_structure} object.
