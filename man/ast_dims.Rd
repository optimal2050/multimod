\title{Create an AST node for dimensions (dims) of a symbol}
\usage{
ast_dims(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more dimension expressions, typically created using
\code{\link[=ast_set]{ast_set()}} or \code{\link[=ast_symbol]{ast_symbol()}}. Expected AST objects or character strings,
comma-separated.
If character strings are provided, they will be converted to \code{ast_symbol} objects.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{ast_dims} and \code{multimod_ast}, representing the dimension nodes.
}
\description{
Constructs an \code{ast_dims} object, which represents the declared dimensions
of a variable, parameter, or equation in a structured symbolic model. Each
dimension is typically represented as a set reference (\code{ast_set}) or as a
symbolic identifier (\code{ast_symbol}). This is similar to \code{ast_index}, but
specifically for dimensions.
}
\examples{
ast_dims(list(ast_set("tech"), ast_set("region")))
ast_dims(ast_symbol("t"))
}
