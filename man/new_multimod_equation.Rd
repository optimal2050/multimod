\title{Create a multimod equation object}
\usage{
new_multimod_equation(
  name,
  desc = NULL,
  dims,
  lhs,
  rhs,
  relation = "==",
  domain = NULL
)

new_equation(name, desc = NULL, dims, lhs, rhs, relation = "==", domain = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Character string. The name of the equation.}

\item{desc}{Optional character string. A description or label for the equation.}

\item{dims}{Character vector. Names of the dimensions over which the equation is declared.}

\item{lhs}{An AST (abstract syntax tree) representing the left-hand side of the equation.}

\item{rhs}{An AST representing the right-hand side of the equation.}

\item{relation}{Character string. The relation type: one of \code{"=="}, \code{"<="}, or \code{">="}.}

\item{domain}{Optional AST or symbol representing the domain/mapping condition for the equation.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{multimod_equation}, containing the parsed equation structure.
}
\description{
Constructs an equation object used in the \code{multimod} modeling framework.
This object represents a single equation, including left-hand side (LHS),
right-hand side (RHS), relation operator (e.g., equality or inequality), and an optional domain.
}
\examples{
lhs <- ast_variable("vTechOut", dims = c("tech", "region"))
rhs <- ast_expression("*", ast_param("pTechEff", dims = c("tech")), ast_variable("vTechInp", dims = c("tech", "region")))
eq <- new_multimod_equation(
  name = "eqTechEff",
  desc = "Technology output efficiency",
  dims = c("tech", "region"),
  lhs = lhs,
  rhs = rhs,
  relation = "=="
)
