<!-- # Development Status and Roadmap -->

The `multimod` package is under active but experimental development. This document outlines current capabilities, design scope, limitations, and roadmap for future enhancements.

## Target Releases

v0.1: GAMS reader and writer, basic AST, LaTeX exporter (internal use)

v0.2: JuMP export and basic reader, full AST, model consistency checks

v0.3: Pyomo, GMPL export, basic readers, updated LaTeX exporter

v0.4: Data connection (`energyRt`), automated mapping parameters

v0.5: Parameter folding, equation simplification, equations to R-functions

v1.0: Polished release with tests, tutorials, CRAN-ready

Expected timeline: 6-12 months for v1.0 (starting from June 2025), with incremental releases every 1-3 months.

## What’s Implemented

- GAMS-style equation parsing into symbolic abstract syntax trees (AST)
- Structured representation of:
  - Sets
  - Parameters
  - Variables
  - Mappings
  - Equations and constraints
- Rendering of equations to:
  - GAMS
  - LaTeX
  - Julia/JuMP (in progress)
- Expression tree visualization with **visNetwork**
- Basic symbolic simplification
- Integration with `energyRt` data structures

---

## Current Limitations

- Limited to **linear programming (LP)** models only
- Designed closely around the `energyRt` models structure
- Only GAMS input is currently supported
- No general-purpose parsing of other languages like JuMP, Pyomo, or AMPL
- Not intended to convert arbitrary code or full model definitions
- No direct support for model data input/output formats

---

## Project Philosophy

The goal of `multimod` is **not** to automate full model translation or parsing. Instead, it aims to:

- Facilitate development and symbolic restructuring of optimization models
- Act as a **transparent intermediate representation** for multi-language export
- Assist with documentation and visualization of models

The symbolic structure enables users to adapt and refine models by hand, especially during development, testing, or educational use.

---

## Potential Use Cases

- Model prototyping and equation editing
- Generation of readable documentation (e.g., LaTeX equation listings)
- Translating symbolic equations across modeling languages (e.g., GAMS ⇄ JuMP ⇄ Pyomo)
- Structural visualization for debugging or collaboration
- Teaching optimization model structure and indexing concepts

---

## Planned Features

- Input parsing support for:
  - `read_jump()`
  - `read_pyomo()`
  - `read_gmpl()`
- Output rendering to:
  - Pyomo, AMPL, GMPL
  - Equation simplification and data-driven dimensions reduction ("folding")
- (Potential) support for:
  - MPS, CPLEX, Gurobi, other formats
  - Nonlinear expressions
  - Integer/binary variables
  - Equation grouping, tagging, and metadata
- Enhanced IDE or browser-based visualizations
