<!-- # Development Status and Roadmap -->

The `multimod` package is under active but experimental development. This document outlines current capabilities, design scope, limitations, and roadmap for future enhancements.

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è What‚Äôs Implemented

- GAMS-style equation parsing into symbolic abstract syntax trees (AST)
- Structured representation of:
  - Sets
  - Parameters
  - Variables
  - Mappings
  - Equations and constraints
- Rendering of equations to:
  - GAMS
  - LaTeX
  - Julia/JuMP (in progress)
- Expression tree visualization with **visNetwork**
- Basic symbolic simplification
- Integration with `energyRt` data structures

---

## üîí Current Limitations

- Limited to **linear programming (LP)** models only
- Designed closely around the `energyRt` models structure
- Only GAMS input is currently supported
- No general-purpose parsing of other languages like JuMP, Pyomo, or AMPL
- Not intended to convert arbitrary code or full model definitions
- No direct support for model data input/output formats

---

## üéØ Project Philosophy

The goal of `multimod` is **not** to automate full model translation or parsing. Instead, it aims to:

- Facilitate development and symbolic restructuring of optimization models
- Act as a **transparent intermediate representation** for multi-language export
- Assist with documentation and visualization of models

The symbolic structure enables users to adapt and refine models by hand, especially during development, testing, or educational use.

---

## üß≠ Potential Use Cases

- Model prototyping and equation editing
- Generation of readable documentation (e.g., LaTeX equation listings)
- Translating symbolic equations across modeling languages (e.g., GAMS ‚áÑ JuMP ‚áÑ Pyomo)
- Structural visualization for debugging or collaboration
- Teaching optimization model structure and indexing concepts

---

## üîú Planned Features

- Input parsing support for:
  - `read_jump()`
  - `read_pyomo()`
  - `read_gmpl()`
- Output rendering to:
  - Pyomo, AMPL, GMPL
  - Equation simplification and data-driven dimensions reduction ("folding")
- (Potential) support for:
  - MPS, CPLEX, Gurobi, other formats
  - Nonlinear expressions
  - Integer/binary variables
  - Equation grouping, tagging, and metadata
- Enhanced IDE or browser-based visualizations

---

## ü§ù Contributing & Sponsorship

The package is under active development. Contributions are welcome!

Ways to help:

- Open issues for bugs, feature requests, or improvements
- Propose support for new modeling targets
- Share use cases or example models
- Sponsor development of specific features (e.g., Pyomo exporter)
